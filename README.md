# Artist Search

**Description:**

This is an artist search website. I used MVC pattern in developing the application using Vue.js which is a web application development framework. I also used Bootstrap and Axios. 

The page contains a search bar. After searching for an artist. The Itunes API generates a list of results as well as the genres of the music by the artist. Each item contains a description and a track info.

| description | track info |

A user can select a genre to update the list. They can also sort the list by collection name and price.
