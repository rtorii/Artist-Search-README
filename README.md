# Artist-Search-README

**Description:**

This is an artist search website. I used MVC pattern in developing the application using Vue.js which is a web application development framework. I also used Bootstrap and Axios. For the Model in MVC, this prorgam uses iTunes API.

The page contains a search bar. After searching for an artist. The Itunes API generates a list of results as well as the genres of the music by the artist.

Each item contains a description and a track info.

Selecting any genre would update the list.

Users can sort the list by collection name and price.
