# Artist Search

[Demo Video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SHw1oNpVSPo)

**Description:**

This is an artist search web application. I used the MVC pattern in developing the application using Vue.js, which is a web application development framework. I also used Bootstrap, which is also a framework. The application requires internet access to get data from the API.

The page contains a search bar. After a user types in an artist and presses the enter key, iTunes Search API returns data (JSON object). Then, the data is used to generate a list of results and the genres of the music by the artist. Each result grid contains an image, a description, and track info.

| Description tab | Track info. tab |
| ------ | ------ |
|<img src="photos_for_README/3_tab1.png" width="470"/>|<img src="photos_for_README/3_tab2.png" width="470"/>|

A user can select a genre to update the list. They can also sort the list by collection name and price.
